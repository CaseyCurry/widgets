# Architect Portal Demo App

This is a demo of a widgets dashboard. It uses the @navihealth/widget-dashboard-ng5 package to render both an Angular 4 and Angular 5 widget among a lot of other random widgets.

The Architect List widget communicates with the Architect Address widget through @navihealth/browser-bus. When an architect is selected or added, the address widget displays the appropriate address.

Repos of the installed @navihealth packages are here...
